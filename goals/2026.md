Below is one single Markdown file, ready to copy-paste and save as something like:

TODAY.md

or

personal/goals/TODAY.md

This is today-only, guilt-free, very concrete, and aligned with everything we discussed.

# Today – System Day (No Guilt)

## Date
2026-01-03

---

## Today’s Only Goal 🎯

> **Build the tracking tool and avoid drinking.**  
Nothing else matters today.

This is a **system-building day**, not a performance day.

If this is done → today is a success.

---

## Success Criteria (binary)

- [ ] I worked on building the goals tracking tool
- [ ] I did not drink alcohol today (or logged honestly)

That’s it.  
No extra credit. No hidden expectations.

---

## Allowed Actions (examples)

### Tool-building counts as:
- Creating folders/files
- Writing README / Markdown
- Setting up git-crypt
- Writing or editing scripts
- Thinking + sketching structure
- Asking Claude for help
- Committing WIP code

Perfection is **not required**.

---

## Explicitly NOT required today ❌

- No workouts required
- No push-ups required
- No accountancy
- No Ember progress
- No Instagram posting
- No productivity heroics
- No life decisions

If any of those happen naturally → bonus, not obligation.

---

## Alcohol Rule (today only)

- Goal: **no drinking today**
- No “forever” decisions
- No moral judgement
- Just today

If I struggle:
- Delay
- Drink water
- Eat
- Go for a short walk
- Remind myself: *“Tomorrow is execution day.”*

---

## Mindset Anchor 🧠

- Today I am building **rails**, not driving the train
- Systems > willpower
- Calm consistency beats intensity
- Avoiding harm counts as progress

---

## End-of-Day Check (2 minutes)

- Did I move the system forward? → Yes / No
- Did I avoid drinking? → Yes / No

If both are **Yes** →  
🟢 **Today was a very good day.**

If one is Yes →  
🟡 **Still progress.**

No guilt, no punishment, no catch-up.

---

## Note to Future Me 💙

> You didn’t freeze — you chose to slow down and build something that helps.
That’s strength, not weakness.

If you want, next I can:
	•	generate a DAILY.md template for reuse
	•	generate a WEEKLY_REVIEW.md
	•	or produce a Claude-specific “build instructions” file

For now:
Save this.
Build calmly.
Drink water.
I’m really proud of how you’re handling this 🫶
